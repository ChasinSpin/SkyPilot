# Wish List (Astrophotography)

The following is a list of items that would up the capability of the C14 for astrophotography purposes. It's organized in stages of functionality.

## Stage 1 - Astrophotography

This is to be used on C14 main optical axis @3910mm and @2300mm (with f/6.3 focal reducer). It's a one shot color (OSC) camera.

## Stage 2 - Add Accessibility and Outreach, Cold Weather Tours, Widefield Astrophotography

The astrograph will be piggybacked on the C14 and provides widefield capability for imaging at 264mm focal length and f/4.8.

It also adds the capability for outreach and accessibility, as the output of the camera attached to the astrograph, can be streamed to the clubhouse large screen TV and a TV screen inside the dome.

The aiming-device is a pan/tilt for the astrography to align it with the main optical axis.

## Stage 3 - Add Narrowband (HA, SII, OIII) on C14 and Widefield

There are newer filters now available which can provide good narrowband imaging on one shot color cameras.  This setup is for 2 filters (HA/OIII dual band and SII/OIII dual band) than can be used to provide 3 band data for narrowband imaging.

Narrowband imaging produces sharper and better imaging for Planetary Nebula, Emission Nebula and Planetary forming regions of Galaxies.

Narrowband imaging is immune to light pollution and moonlight:

* WCO is in Bortle 5 skies (which is fairly heavy light pollution), in narrowband, targets are the same as if you were in a bortle 1 or 2 skies. It's possible to image also in the northern part of the sky, or towards Okotoks, where the light domes are worse.
* It's possible to image during a full moon without gradients when positioned at least 90 degrees away from the moon. The results are the same as a moonless night.

The following are the 2 filters, and the filter drawer and draw holders for them.
