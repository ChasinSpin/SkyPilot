# Wish List (Astrophotography)

The following is a list of items that will improve the club's C14 as a resource for astrophotography and outreach / member use.  If you can help in anyway, it would be appreciated by members.

## Phase 1 - Add "Goto" to the C14 (Completed)

Build a custom goto system for the C14 to turn manual operation into automated with goto and auto-guiding capability.  Designed by Mark Simpson using 3D printed parts and a strainwave gear for declination, it leverages the manual mount/fork structure for durability and adds motion to both axis.

This phase has been completed.  Resolution is 0.25 arc seconds, and guiding is 0.5 arc seconds which is better than the 2 arc seconds needed for astrophotography.

## Phase 2 - Plate Solving (Completed)

Plate solving is needed for accurate targeting of objects. This phase uses a guide camera on the Orion ST80 combined with an ASIAIR to provide plate solve ability. When Phase 2 is complete, the guide camera will be repurposed into a guide camera and the main camera will be doing the plate solving.

This has been donated to the club by Daniel and Nancy Boychuk.

## Phase 3 - Astrophotography

This is to be used on C14 main optical axis @3910mm and @2300mm (with f/6.3 focal reducer). It's a one shot color (OSC) camera. It provides the ability for club members to take astrophotography data/images/scientific research on the clubs C14.

| **TOTAL (inc. shipping and tax)** | $2289.61 CAD |

Additional to this phase is the flat panel which has already been purchased via club donations, when it was on discount at Christmas.

## Phase 4 - Add Accessibility and Outreach, Cold Weather Tours, Widefield Astrophotography

The astrograph will be piggybacked on the C14 and provides widefield capability for imaging at 264mm focal length and f/4.8.

It also adds the capability for outreach and accessibility, as the output of the camera attached to the astrograph, can be streamed to the clubhouse large screen TV and a TV screen inside the dome.

The aiming-device is a pan/tilt for the astrography to align it with the main optical axis.

| **TOTAL (inc. shipping, tax, duties)** | $1872.55 CAD |

## Phase 5 - Add Narrowband (HA, SII, OIII) on C14 and Widefield

There are newer filters now available which can provide good narrowband imaging on one shot color cameras.  This setup is for 2 filters (HA/OIII dual band and SII/OIII dual band) than can be used to provide 3 band data for narrowband imaging.

Narrowband imaging produces sharper and better imaging for Planetary Nebula, Emission Nebula and Planetary forming regions of Galaxies.

Narrowband imaging is immune to light pollution and moonlight:

* WCO is in Bortle 5 skies (which is fairly heavy light pollution), in narrowband, targets are the same as if you were in a bortle 1 or 2 skies. It's possible to image also in the northern part of the sky, or towards Okotoks, where the light domes are worse.
* It's possible to image during a full moon without gradients when positioned at least 90 degrees away from the moon. The results are the same as a moonless night.

The following are the 2 filters, and the filter drawer and holders for them.
