# Project SkyPilot

## Introduction

Project SkyPilot is a project to design / build / retrofit the C14 in the Wilson Coulee Observation dome with custom goto capabilities.  It leverages all the good parts of the existing mount (Ed Byers Gearing, Fork Mount etc.), whilst bringing it up to date with modern capabilities like:

* Goto (Catalog objects, RA/DEC etc.)
* Computer control
* Mobile phone/tablet control
* Faster slews
* Accurate tracking
* Auto guiding
* Astrophotography
* Dome control

*Although it provides automation, this is not a remote observatory due to safety and the potential for equipment to get damaged, other than control from the site itself.*

## Site
