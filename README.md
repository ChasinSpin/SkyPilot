# Project SkyPilot

## Introduction

Project SkyPilot is a project to design / build / retrofit the C14 in the Wilson Coulee Observation dome with custom goto capabilities.  It leverages all the good parts of the existing mount (Ed Byers Gearing, Fork Mount etc.), whilst bringing it up to date with modern capabilities like:

* Goto (Catalog objects, RA/DEC etc.)
* Computer control
* Mobile phone/tablet control
* Faster slews
* Accurate tracking
* Auto guiding
* Astrophotography
* Dome control

*Although it provides automation, this is not a remote observatory, and that ability will not be provided due to safety and the potential for equipment to get damaged, other than control from the site itself.*

## Time Scales

The project will take a few months as I iterate the design, especially given the cold weather.  There will be very minimal interruption to regular usage, and I’ll be avoiding events I know about or are on the calendar.  I may need to test on the occasional clear night as I dial everything in.

## Changes To Usage

There will be minor changes to usage procedures, which I will detail as they occur, but fundamentally if you’re a purely visual observer, not much will change apart from the Dec clutch, the addition of some hardware/cables, and a new hand controller.

For others who want to use the Goto more extensively or for Astrophotography, when complete, I’ll be doing a training session, and you will need to be checked out to access the new functionality, so you can make full use of it.
