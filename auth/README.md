# Dome Access

Access to the dome is via an access key (card or fob). To obtain an access key (the first included in your dome fee), contact the Site Manager and arrange pickup.

Please keep the access key safe; if you lose it, the dog eats it, etc., you will be asked for a small donation to the club to get a replacement.

The touchpad for access is the black box with the LED light on the door frame, the area you touch is the "star constellation," not the LED.

Follow the operation instructions below carefully. All accesses are logged, and failure to lock up correctly will result in you being contacted and asked to return to the site immediately to resolve.

# Instructions

## Entering

1. Hold the card/fob for a second or two, flat to the constellation star pattern and a few millimeters away from the touchpad

2. LED will change to mostly on with the occasional flash-off

3. PUSH ON THE DOOR and then pull to open (this is needed because of the pressure of the door seal)

4. Your name will be displayed on the small lower display just inside by the door

5. The door is now unlocked until you relock it, and you can move in and out by just pushing the door.  In this mode (open), it takes very little force to open/close the door, this is normal.

6. Be aware that if there is wind, the door may blow open, put the latch on the door if this is an issue (you likely want to cool the dome/C14 down for viewing anyway)


## Exiting

1. Hold the card/fob for a second or two, flat to the constellation star pattern and a few millimeters away from the touchpad

2. LED will change to mostly off with the occasional flash-on

3. PUSH IN THE DOOR and then pull to check it’s closed (this is needed because of the pressure of the door seal)

4. The door is now locked and armed

5. If you leave without closing correctly, an alarm will be sent to the Site Manager after a period, which will likely result in a phone call to you, and you’ll be asked to go back and lock up.


## Handing Over To Another

If you opened the dome, and someone else is closing, then when you leave, swipe to close yourself and have the person that’s taking over swipe to open.  That way, you’re logged out, and the next person is logged in. Locking up the dome correctly is now the responsibility of the next person.

Never hand over to someone who isn't an authorized dome user.

## Notes

1. The touchpad is on a 3-second lockout so that you can’t enter and exit at the same time.  I.E. After you’ve tapped, if you remove your key card, you have to wait 3 seconds before presenting another or the same card.

2. Currently, you tap to unlock and relock rather than tap every time you open the door like other systems you’ve likely encountered.  The reason is that we don’t want anyone locked out with their vehicle keys or keycards within the building.

3. For fire purposes, anyone inside can always get out by depressing the handle on the inside.

4. There’s an override key in case there's a hardware failure to get in conventionally.  Eric has the location information for the key if needed.

5. On power failure, the system is locked, and a conventional key needs to be used.

6. When using the dome, please do not unplug the system, and check that no one has unplugged it before you leave. The flashing LED on the touchpad indicates the system is powered

7. Cabling will be covered when I get time to make it look cleaner; in the meantime, please don’t rest any chairs against the gear, etc.
