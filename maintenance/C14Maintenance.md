# C14 Maintenance

## RA Drive

1. Remove the 6 bolted black bearing axle holder on the right hand outside of the RA casing (be careful, when tightening later, one of the bolts has already been stripped

2. Back-off the right0hand grub screw (in a pair on the left-hand side of the worm axle), it's spring-loaded

3. Slide the axle to the right and remove it.  IMPORTANT, there's a single bearing that's just held in by grease surface tension on the left-hand side (where the bronze bearing is), remove and store it safely for later, when the axle is removed, OTA will fall down to the lowest gravity point, mind your head

4. Unbolt the stepper motor and remove

5. Use the electrical degreaser in the basement with "blue shop towel", to clean the worm axle and large RA gear in the C14 and the aluminimum gear on the worm axle, DO NOT use the degreaser on the nylon gear on the stepper.  Wipe off all the degreaser.

6. Remove the brass bushing/bearing from the worm axle and inspect where it joins for rubbing after degreasing.  It's a tight push fit and just needs to be pulled apart

7. Clean nylon stepper gear with shop towel, inspect for wear and replace if necessary

8. ONLY USE SuperLube for the grease (white lithium separates over time and doesn't handle the speeds necessary or cold well).  Lube the worm, the brass bushing, the alumninum gear on the worm axle, and the main large RA gear.  Also lube the nylon gear on the stepper

9. Put grease in the end of the axle and place the ball bearing.  On the ball bearing holder on the right hand side, put a bit of grease inside

10. Reassemble

11. Adjust the left hand spring tension on the brass bushing via the grub screw so that the rotation isn't restricted with too much friction

12. Adjust the bolt post on the left hand black bearing holder in the center if needed to tighten up any left/right movement of the axle, i.e. this is a backlash adjustment for RA

13. Test at goto slew speeds

## DEC Drive

Ordinarily, the DEC shouldn't need much maintenance as the Strainwave/Harmonic Drive gear is enclosed and there's no lubrication needed anywhere.  Therefore, this just contains instructions for disassembly in case there are any failures that need repairing.

Gearing is 400:1 with the strainwave gear being 100:1 and a 4:1 stepper to strainwave input gearing.

1. Remove outer casing using an Allen key to reveal the stepper motor, drive axle and belts
2. Inspect stepper belt for wear
3.	Unscrew the DEC Movement Indicator
4. 	Insert the 1/4 - 20 threaded rod with 2 nuts on into the bronze axle and screw in (don't tighten).  Attach electric drill to this thread in a clockwise motion and rotate via the drill to line up the bolts to the gap in the housing for removal.
5. Remove the plate to plate connector bolts (the OTA will fall with the last bolt removal)
6. With the drill running anticlockwise, unscrew the threaded rod
7. Remove the bolts that attach the housing to the telescope
8. Remove the central nuts and fender washer
9. Remove the 4 bolts attaching the plate to the hub
10. Remove the center bolt and the 2 outside bolts to free the hub from the DEC bearing

Reassembly is the reverse of disassembly.
