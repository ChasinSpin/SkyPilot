# Usage Rules

Access to the Wilson Coulee dome, is a privilege available to members in good standing who have been with the club for a while and known to the committee members for a period.  A requirement for access is that the user is trained/checked out on the equipment, is careful in the handling of the equipment, and follows the procedures for its operation.

The C14 is used for tours, the youth group, and other events and is a shared resource.  Damage to the C14 results in the telescope being out of commission, which directly impacts the club's operations.  To ensure this doesn’t happen, it’s necessary to have rules for its use which members are required to adhere to.

There are two levels of dome usage, Visual and Astrophotography, and training and verification of your skills are required for both.

SkyPilot is a new custom goto, and the occasional gremlins/bugs should be expected. Please notify Mark Simpson or the site manager of any operational issues.

### Visual

Visual use ONLY of the C14. Capabilities are:

* Goto with SkyPilot
* Hand Controller
* Control via SkySafari on your phone or tablet
* Visual lenses and focuser
* Finder Scopes: Telrad, Silver Finderscope

###### It's is not permitted with this level of access to use for Astrophotography (including using your own astrophotography gear or cameras)

### Astrophotography

This level of access includes the visual level, provides access to use the club's Astrophotography gear as well as attaching your own gear, including DSLRs/Cameras.

Capabilities are:

* Bring Your Own Astrophotography Gear
* Auto Guiding - *Future Capability*
* OSC APS-C Sensor - *Future Capability*
* Narrowband Filters - *Future Capability*
* C14 and Widefield Imaging (3910mm and 250mm focal length) - *Future Capability*

## General

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:

* Adjust any equipment, alignment, modify, rotate, remove (even temporarily), clean lenses/filters/sensors, without prior authorization of the Site Manager.  This includes the guide/finder scopes, cameras, and Telrad.
* Place club equipment on the pier (where it can fall) or on the shelf near the trash can (where it can fall into the trash can).
* Remove any equipment from the dome, including the Flat Panel, Cameras, Filters and do NOT use any of the equipment on any scopes other than the C14



## SkyPilot (Goto)

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:
* Attempt to move the OTA manually or apply pressure in Declination when attaching equipment to avoid increasing drive backlash or damage. C14 cover must ALWAYS be placed lightly on the OTA
* Connect anything by wire to the SkyPilot controller mounted on the mount base. This includes the USB and ST4 ports (which will damage your equipment and SkyPilot)
* Connect your own laptop or device to any of the club's equipment. (Wifi is the only way to control the mount)
* Use SkyPilot outside of the temperature limits specified
* Disconnect any wires during operation. Drivers will be damaged if unplugged during operation due to surge.

#### DO:

* Move the scope with the electronic control only
* Power off by removing the main power plug from the power outlet on the pier when leaving. A scope left on will continue to move and cause damage

#### ALWAYS:
* Park the scope via the PARK menu option when shutting down the dome
* Be in the dome during any goto operation.  Under no circumstances should a goto be done from outside the dome or in the clubhouse
* Carefully watch any goto and stop the operation if damage is imminent. Attention must be paid to the stairs being too close to the mount, wires, cable wrapping, equipment, cameras/gear hitting the forks or base, and people around the telescope

### Usage:

1. Plug main power into the pier socket on entry to the dome (it takes a few minutes for SkyPilot to boot up WiFi)
2. Open dome
3. Connect to WCODome\_2.4G or WCODome\_5G with your phone or tablet
4. Switch on Hand Controller
5. Set RA to zero (loosen the RA clutches, move and retighten).  OTA should be pointing south.
6. On Hand Controller, UNPARK
7. Slew to position and complete a 1 star align to increase pointing accuracy/register telescope pointing model:
	
	Hand Controller:
	
	* Use joystick on hand controller to slew and center target
	
	SkySafari:
		
	* Tap on target (star or planet)
	* Tap Goto
	* Center target in finderscope using SkySafari or hand controller Joystick controls
	* Tap Align

	ASIAIR:
	
	* Switch ASIAIR on
	* Connect via app
	* Take photo
	* Tap Platesolve
	* Tap Sync and Goto
	* Take photo (target should be centered)
	* ALWAYS SHUTDOWN ASIAIR before switching off / removing power

	ASTRID:
	
	* Switch ASTRID on
	* Switch to Dome Wifi network
	* Take photo
	* Tap Platesolve
	* Tap Sync and Goto
	* Take photo (target should be centered)
	* ALWAYS SHUTDOWN ASTRID before switching off / removing power

### Temperature Limits (Preliminary):

These may be changed as we test:

* < -20C:	Scope cannot be used
* -10C to -20C: Change Max Slew Rate to "Cold Weather"
* Above -10C: Change Max Slew Rate to "Normal"

Note: "Insane Mode" can only be used > 0C

If the temperature limit is inappropriate for the slew rate, the steppers will stall on goto, make a whining noisem, and position will be lost, you will then need to do a 1 star align to be able to goto and park.

### Troubleshooting:

#### Unable to communicate with mount:

1. Check your device is on the dome wifi
2. Check wifi router (south wall) has green lights
3. Power cycle SkyPilot mount (pull power plug, wait 10 seconds and reinsert), then when reconnected do a 1 star alignment

#### Unable to move mount:

1. Mount has software limits and you may have hit one.  Try slewing the mount with the hand controller joystick in various directions to move away from the limit and then complete a 1 star alignment so the mount knows where it is


## SkyPilot (Handset)

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:

* Connect anything to the USB-C port on the handset.  It is only for programming and will most likely damage your device and the hand controller
* Place the hand controller anywhere other than around your neck or in its permanent storage location. The hand controller will break if dropped. DO NOT rest the hand controller on the pier.

#### DO:

* Always use the hand controller with the lanyard over your neck. This ensures it cannot fall.
* Switch off the hand controller when you have finished your observing session, or if you won't be using it for a while (for example because you are using the ASIAIR) to save battery
* Replace batteries when necessary

### Usage:

1. Put handset around neck
2. Power on handset
3. Wait for connection
4. 	Unpark (ASIAIR/SkySafari will not move the scope if you don't unpark)
5. Use joystick mode to slew if required
6. Power off handset if not using to save battery (i.e. in clubhouse, using the ASIAIR platesolving)
7. When finished, switch on handset (if off), and Park scope, wait for it to finish returning to the park position
8. Power off handset

### Buttons:

(buttons need to be fully depressed)
	
* 4 Black Buttons are the joystick (N,S,E,W):
	1. In menu mode, you use these to navigate the menu
	2. In joystick mode you use these to slew the scope.
* Yellow Button toggles between menu mode and joystick mode

* F1 = Blue Button, F2 = White Button.  In joystick mode, F1 decreases the slew rate and F2 increases the slew rate

### Troubleshooting:

#### White error text on display

If you are in the dome and received the text (i.e. not weak wifi), then take a photo of the text and send to Mark.  Then power cycle the handset to recover.

#### Warning about low power or power drop

Replace batteries

#### Hand controller frozen

Power cycle hand controller.  If that doesn't fix it, switch off hand controller, power cycle SkyPilot mount, and switch on hand controller and wait for connection.

## Sky Safari

SkySafari Plus or Pro (available on tablet and phone for iOS or Android) will connect wirelessly with the SkyPilot goto controller.  Note: SkySafari regular (Basic) does not have telescope control.

To control SkyPilot via Sky Safari, you must setup the connection as follows in SkySafari:

1. Menu / Settings / Telescope / Presets / Add Preset
2. Other
3. Mount Type: Equatorial GoTo (Fork)
4. Scope Type: Meade LX200 Classic
5. (Tap Next)
6. IP Address: 192.168.1.200
7. Port Number: 9998
8. Preset Name: WCO SkyPilot
9. Set Telescope Time & Location: THIS MUST BE SWITCHED OFF!
10. Readout Rate: 4 per second
11. Timeout Seconds: 3.0
12. Tap "Save Preset"
13. Select the new preset, so that it's checkmarked
14. Tap the cross (top right) to return to the planetarium view
15. Click "Scope" and "Connect

#### Usage:

1. SkyPilot should be powered on
2. Connect to Dome Wifi
3. Start Sky Safari
4. Tap Scope
5. Tap Connect
6. Tap object and then Goto to slew to that object
7. If the object isn't centered in the silver finder scope, then center with the SkySafari arrows or the handset joystick and tap "Align" in SkySafari to sync the current position to the target position.

## ASIAIR

Currently, the ASIAIR is only to be used for platesolving via the Orion ST80.

### DO NOT:

* Change settings on the ASIAIR
* Do not plug in your own astrophotography equipment
* Connect your laptop to the ASIAIR
* Connect your USB thumbdrive to the ASIAIR at this time
* Remove any SD Cards

### DO:

* Control the ASIAIR via the ASIAIR app on your phone. If you don't have this app, do not power on the ASIAIR
* Shutdown the ASIAIR before removing power to avoid corruption

### Usage:

* Plug in the 12V power supply to the power outlet (the 12V power supply is the smaller blue power supply)
* Switch the ASIAIR on (small power switch on the bottom)
* Wait for the beep to indicate it's ready to go (can take a minute or so)
* Connect your iPhone/tablet to the dome's Wifi
* Start the ASIAIR app
* If the ASIAIR isn't showing, click Scan
* Tap Connect when ASIAIR shows
* Make sure the ASIAIR is in preview mode
* Take photo (white button) - 5 second exposure is good for a plate solve, if you have cloud, then you may want to try 10-30s).
* Tap Plate Solve on the left
* Tap Sync and Goto
* Take another photo if you wish to verify you're in the correct location
* Now you can use the Sky Atlas (constellation button in the bottom left hand corner), to move around the sky.  Remember to Photo, PlateSolve and Sync/Goto to be perfectly positioned on the new target
* REMEMBER TO SHUTDOWN WHEN YOU ARE DONE FOR THE EVENING, BEFORE REMOVING POWER:
	* Tap the Wifi Icon, scroll to the bottom and there's a red button you slide to the right to shutdown.  Wait 30 seconds before removing power.

### Troubleshooting:

#### No ASIAIR listed to connect to

* ASIAIR has no power or isn't switched on
* You are not connected to the dome's Wifi network

#### No PlateSolve

* Cloud, expose longer

#### Camera Not Found

* Camera on the Orion ST80 has a magentic attachment, check the cable is attached to this
* Tap icon that looks like a camera, find the camera in the list (ASI174MM), select it and switch it on.  DO NOT CHANGE ANY SETTINGS.



## Bring Your Own Astrophotography Gear or Laptop

**You must have the Astrophotography level of access training before attaching your own gear including any cameras or DSLR**

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:

* Attach / piggyback a DSLR, Camera or Other equipment to any of the rails or Optical Tube. (there are equatorial platforms available for rent for DSLRs via the club’s rental program)
* Connect a laptop or other device to any of the clubs equipment, other than over Wifi
* Change any settings on the ASIAIR
* Use any gear belonging to the club with your devices, i.e. do not connect any of the clubs cameras to your laptop for example

#### DO

* You may attach a camera to the visual back of the C14 ONLY (i.e. where the eyepiece goes), if you have the correct mating adapter and are careful not to damage the threads on the visual back
* Replace the visual train on the visual back after use, ready for the next person

## Flat Panel

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:

* Remove or use outside the dome. The flat panel is only for the C14.
* Use the flat panel when the OTA is pointing below 20 degrees elevation (it can fall and will break)

#### DO:

* Always cover with the protective cover and put away in the cupboard when not actively taking a flat field
* Be careful when using to avoiding scratching
* Do not clean, it scratches easily. If it needs cleaning, contact the Site Manager

#### Usage:

* Position OTA so that it is angled about 20 degrees up from horizontal (so the panel can't fall)
* Place panel onto rim of the OTA, being careful not to damage the flat panel surface with the rim
* Connect 12V DC Power from the pier to the flat panel
* Take flats (only necessary to take 5 images optimized for about 30% on the histogram)

## Filters - Future Capability

### Rules:

#### DO NOT:

* Blow on filters, spit is impossible to clean off once set in
* Clean filters, contact site manager if a filter needs clearning
* Store filter outside of filter container. Place immediately in container. This avoids dust which impacts imaging.c
